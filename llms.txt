> Deterministic AI Decision Systems for Enterprise

## About
Ferrum Data Works builds auditable, deterministic decision workflows that integrate AI as an advisor, not a black-box decision maker. We help regulated industries (Fintech, Insurance, Healthcare) deploy AI safely by wrapping probabilistic models in explicit, rule-based logic.

## Core Philosophy
- **Deterministic Execution:** Input A + Logic B always equals Output C.
- **Auditability:** Every decision step is logged, versioned, and explainable.
- **Type Safety:** Strict input/output validation; no loose JSON.
- **AI as Advisor:** AI models provide scores/classifications; business logic makes the final decision.

## Architecture
1. **Ingest:** Normalize data from DBs, APIs, and streams (Redis Data Integration).
2. **Design:** Visual, no-code workflow editor for business logic.
3. **Compile:** Flows are compiled to bytecode for zero-runtime interpretation errors.
4. **Execute:** Redis Streams orchestrate state machines with sub-millisecond latency.
5. **Audit:** Immutable logs of every step, input, and output.

## Solutions
- **Credit Decisioning:** Real-time loan approvals with full explainability.
- **Claims Triage:** Automated insurance claim routing and fraud detection.
- **Compliance & KYC:** Continuous monitoring and regulatory reporting.
- **Content Moderation:** Hybrid AI + Human workflows for platform safety.
- **Operations Routing:** Intelligent dispatch for logistics and field service.
- **Enterprise RAG:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation with evidence chains and guardrails.
