> Deterministic AI Decision Systems for Enterprise

## The Problem: The Decision System Trilemma
Enterprises face an impossible choice for decision systems:
1. **Black-box AI:** Fast but opaque. Regulatory liability.
2. **Hardcoded Rules:** Auditable but brittle. Slow to change.
3. **Enterprise AI Platforms:** 18-month integration hell.

## The Solution: Determinism + Fluidity
Ferrum builds **deterministic decision systems that are also adaptive**.
- **Architectural Insight:** Decisions are logical computations, not neural predictions.
- **The Inversion:** AI is an *advisor* (confidence score), not the decision-maker. The rule decides.
- **Execution Substrate:** Built on Redis Streams for sub-millisecond latency and immutable audit logs.

## Core Capabilities
- **Visual Design:** Business stakeholders design flows; we compile them to bytecode.
- **Compliance:** "Show me all denials from Q4" is a trivial SQL-like query.
- **Data Integration:** Redis Data Integration (RDI) or lightweight adapters.
- **ROI:** 90 days to production. 200-500% Year 1 ROI.

## Architecture
1. **Ingest:** Normalize data from DBs, APIs, and streams.
2. **Design:** Visual workflow editor.
3. **Compile:** Deterministic bytecode. Zero runtime surprises.
4. **Execute:** Redis Streams state machine.
5. **Audit:** Complete evidence chain for every decision.

## Use Cases
- **Credit Decisioning:** Explainable loan approvals.
- **Claims Triage:** Automated routing and fraud detection.
- **Compliance:** Continuous KYC/AML monitoring.
- **Content Moderation:** Hybrid AI/Human workflows.
